![FullDots: a chat with Scout, a research Dot](docs/screenshots/home.png)

FullDots is a workspace for AI agents called **Dots**. Each Dot has a role, instructions, a model, the tools you grant it and, optionally, its own computer with a browser, files and a shell. You chat with a Dot, schedule work for it and review what it did.

Everything runs on your machine. Conversations, pages and settings are stored in one SQLite file, there is no account and no telemetry, and the app contacts only the services you configure.

> [!NOTE]
> FullDots is alpha software, built for a single owner: there are no user accounts or shared workspaces. It is a fork of [CopilotKit OpenDots](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDots); see [FullDots and OpenDots](#fulldots-and-opendots).

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### Local-first by design

Conversations stay in a local SQLite file instead of a hosted thread service. Telemetry is switched off in code, and web search uses DuckDuckGo, so no search key is needed.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### Bring your own model

Fourteen provider presets, from OpenAI and Anthropic to Ollama and LM Studio, plus any OpenAI-compatible server. Keys are encrypted at rest, and each Dot can use its own model.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

#### Connect your tools over MCP

Notion, Linear, Atlassian, Sentry, Stripe, Hugging Face and more. Sign in with your browser, with no OAuth app to register. Each Dot gets only the tools you grant it, read-only by default.

</td>
<td valign="top">

#### Approvals for risky actions

Sending, paying, deleting, publishing and destructive commands pause for you. An approval covers that exact action, once, and a paused turn survives a restart.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

#### You take over for secrets

A Dot stops before it types a password, a verification code or a captcha answer. You take over its live screen, finish the step and hand it back.

</td>
<td valign="top">

#### A computer for each Dot

An optional container per Dot with a browser, files and a shell. Its screen streams into the app, and every action is recorded in an audit trail.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

#### Always-on work

Standing goals that run until the Dot says they are done, several Dots working in the background at once, and triggers from webhooks or connector polls. See [Automations](docs/AUTOMATIONS.md).

</td>
<td valign="top">

#### Token use and budgets

Tokens per Dot per day from the provider's own counts, a daily warning, and an optional budget that pauses a Dot's background work until tomorrow.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

#### Teams of Dots

A Dot hands part of a task to a teammate whose role fits it, and gets the result back in the same conversation. See [Teams](docs/TEAMS.md).

</td>
<td valign="top">

#### Pause, backup, take back control

Pause one Dot or all of them, and copy everything to a safe backup with `npm run backup`, even while FullDots runs.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Node.js 24 or newer with npm, and either an API key for a supported provider or a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) server.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/asasemahmed/FullDots.git
cd FullDots
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>, then add a provider in **Settings → Models**. You can also set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_MODEL` in `.env` and restart. Without a model, the app shows a setup screen and never invents replies.

### With Docker

```sh
cp .env.example .env    # set OWNER_TOKEN to a random string of 24+ characters
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open <http://localhost:4310>. The port is bound to loopback, and data lives in the `opendots-data` volume.

### Optional extras

- **Dot computers** need Docker. See [Computers](docs/COMPUTERS.md).
- **Page reader, voice calls and backups** are covered in [Setup](docs/SETUP.md).
- **Connectors** are added in **Settings → Connectors**. See [Connectors](docs/CONNECTORS.md).

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  UI["Web app<br/>React"] <--> Server["FullDots server<br/>Hono + CopilotKit runtime"]
  Server --> DB[("SQLite<br/>conversations, pages,<br/>settings, audit")]
  Server --> Models["Model providers<br/>cloud or local"]
  Server --> Search["DuckDuckGo search"]
  Server --> Gate{"Approval gate"}
  Gate --> MCP["MCP connectors"]
  Gate --> Computers["Dot computers<br/>Docker, optional"]
```

Every turn runs through the server. Before a Dot uses a computer or a connector, the approval gate checks the action against that Dot's grants and approval mode. An action that needs you pauses the turn and is recorded, and the turn resumes once you decide.

## Configuration

All settings live in `.env`. [`.env.example`](.env.example) lists every variable with its default.

| Variable                                            | Purpose                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_MODEL` | The built-in default provider. Add others in **Settings → Models**.                         |
| `OWNER_TOKEN`                                       | Required (24+ characters) when `HOST` is not loopback, and by the Docker setup.             |
| `APP_ORIGIN`                                        | The exact address you open the app at. Browser sign-in for connectors redirects back to it. |
| `DATABASE_PATH`                                     | The SQLite file. Default `data/opendots.sqlite`.                                            |
| `CONNECTOR_SECRET_KEY`                              | Key for stored secrets. If unset, `data/connector.key` is created once.                     |
| `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER`                               | `duckduckgo` (default) or `disabled`.                                                       |
| `CONNECTORS_ALLOW_STDIO`                            | Lets connectors start local programs. Off by default.                                       |
| `AGENT_TURN_TIMEOUT`, `AGENT_MAX_STEPS`             | How long and how many steps a Dot may take in one turn. Defaults: 90 seconds and 8 steps.   |
| `NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`                                | Optional. Receives a title, text and link for new approvals, handoffs and usage warnings.   |
| `BACKGROUND_CONCURRENCY`                            | Background tasks running at once (different Dots). Default 2, at most 8.                    |
| `DOT_DAILY_TOKEN_WARN`                              | Tokens per Dot per day before you are warned. Default 2,000,000.                            |
| `TEAM_MAX_DEPTH`                                    | How many hand-offs between Dots may chain. Default 2.                                       |

## Security

- **Your data stays local.** Outbound traffic goes only to your model providers, DuckDuckGo, the connectors you add and the pages a Dot reads.
- **Secrets are encrypted.** Model keys and connector tokens are stored with AES-256-GCM. Secrets set in `.env` are read from the environment and never stored or shown.
- **Remote access needs a token.** The server refuses to start on a non-loopback `HOST` without an `OWNER_TOKEN` of 24+ characters.
- **Risky actions wait for you.** Approvals and handoffs keep you in the loop. The checks are heuristics, not a sandbox; see [Approvals](docs/APPROVALS.md).
- **Leaks are tested.** [`tests/security.test.ts`](tests/security.test.ts) plants secrets where the server keeps them and checks that none reach a response, webhook, model request, stored conversation, audit record or log line.

FullDots has not been independently audited. Read [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the design, its limits and how to report a vulnerability privately.

## FullDots and OpenDots

FullDots was forked from [CopilotKit OpenDots](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDots) at upstream commit `c2569bb` (2 October 2026), and the upstream history is kept in this repository.

OpenDots has kept moving since the fork. FullDots does not merge upstream wholesale; useful changes are ported one at a time, adapted and tested, and listed in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Page deletion ([#49](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDots/pull/49)) and most upstream bug fixes are in. Not ported: dark mode ([#81](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDots/pull/81), FullDots will need its own), OpenDots's per-Dot MCP connections ([#52](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDots/pull/52), FullDots has its own connectors), and anything tied to telemetry or the hosted Intelligence service.
