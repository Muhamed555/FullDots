# Notice

## Origin

FullDots is derived from **OpenDots** by CopilotKit (<https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDots>). It was forked at upstream commit `c2569bb` ("feat: add Parallel search and extraction to research", PR #15, 2 October 2026). OpenDots is licensed under the MIT License, Copyright (c) Atai Barkai. That notice is kept in [LICENSE](LICENSE), and the upstream commit history is preserved in this repository.

FullDots is an independent project. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by CopilotKit. "CopilotKit" and "OpenDots" are names of their respective owners and are used here only to identify the original work.

Selected changes made upstream after the fork point are ported individually; each ported commit names its upstream pull request. See [FullDots and OpenDots](README.md#fulldots-and-opendots).

## What FullDots changed

Relative to OpenDots at `c2569bb`:

- Conversations are stored by a local SQLite agent runner ([`src/server/sqlite-runner.ts`](src/server/sqlite-runner.ts)) instead of CopilotKit Intelligence. The runner is adapted from CopilotKit's MIT-licensed `@copilotkit/sqlite-runner` and rewritten for `node:sqlite` with local thread endpoints.
- Voice compute, call receipts and scheduled turns run in process through that runner.
- Parallel web search is replaced by keyless DuckDuckGo search ([`src/server/web-search.ts`](src/server/web-search.ts)) and the local read-only page reader.
- CopilotKit telemetry is disabled in code ([`src/server/privacy.ts`](src/server/privacy.ts)). OpenRouter attribution headers are not sent.
- Slack channels and Automatic Learning, which depend on CopilotKit Intelligence, are removed.
- Added: model providers (Settings → Models), MCP connectors with browser sign-in, approvals, owner handoff, one turn per Dot, a live computer view, configurable work limits, an audit trail, an optional notification webhook, a redesigned interface, and a larger test suite. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists them.

## Third-party components

FullDots depends on open-source packages, including CopilotKit, AG-UI, TanStack AI, the Model Context Protocol SDK, Hono, React, Tiptap, Playwright and Simple Icons. Each is under its own license; see `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

Dot computers use container images built from CopilotKit OpenBot (MIT). See [`deployment/computers/`](deployment/computers/README.md), which carries OpenBot's license in [`LICENSE.openbot`](deployment/computers/LICENSE.openbot).
